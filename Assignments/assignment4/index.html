    <p>Oh well it's up with the White and Gold,<br>
        Down with the Red and Black,<br>
        Georgia Tech is out for a victory.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We'll drop the battle-axe on georgia's head,<br>
    When we meet her our team is sure to beat her.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Down on the old farm there will be no sound <br>
        Till our bow-wows rip through the air;<br>
        When the battle is over Georgia's team will be found<br>
        With the Yellow Jackets swarming around!<br>
